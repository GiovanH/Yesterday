<span class='top'>Hi! Welcome to Yesterday. </span>
<span class='min'>(Named after the day the event you missed was actually on!)</span>
<span class='top'>It used to be that I would spend about an hour every day checking what events were coming up, going through my (already crowded) email and adding events to my calendar by <i>hand</i>, like a barbarian. No more, I said!</span>
<span class='top'>Yesterday is an easy way of keeping track of events on campus. Every event on campus is already entered into the Comet Calendar, but it provides no way of accessing those calendars except through UTD's awful website! So, I made Yesterday to keep track of every event on the calendar, organize them, and add them to my calendar automatically. But then I thought, "everyone should be using this!" So now, that's reality. </span>
<span class='top'>To use the calendars, you can either download as many .ics files below as you want, and import them into your mail or calendar application of choice. (Outlook, iCloud, iCalendar iPhone, Android, Google Calendar, and more are all supported) Or, if you want a live updating version, some mail clients will allow you to copy the URL to the calendar and import that, allowing the calendar to regularly update with fresh entries. </span>
<span class='top'>If you want to help me continue providing resources in my free time, or just want to send me a thank you, you can send me a few dollars with either a <a href='https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01FIS82WQ'>gift card</a> (just <a href='MAILTO:stg160130@'>email</a> it!) or a recurring donation via my <a href='http://www.patreon.com/giovan'>patreon.</a> </span>
<span class='top'>Thank you for your support. I really appreciate it, it lets me keep making more content like this, and it keeps this up and running. </span>
<span class='top'>Now, the calendars! Sorted either by AUTHOR (What institution posted the events) or TAG (what interests the event was tagged with)</span>
